    "description": "\"Hawaii - The Pace of Formation\" is a window into the creation of an island. The Kilauea Volcano's continued flow of lava into the ocean is one of the few places in the world to provide a front row seat of an island's formation. The Big Island is literally changing before your eyes. This vast island contains 8 out of 13 different climate zones in the world, each with unique ecosystems, making the Big Island one of the most ecologically diverse places in the world. To showcase its diversity, we wanted to slow things down and let its beauty speak for itself.

Reinvented and told entirely through movement, the film playfully deconstructs the role of this woman, who encounters a world full of bold characters that are alternately terrifying and sublime. MA is a journey into the visceral and the surreal, interweaving ritual, performance, and the body as sculpture. The absence of dialogue stirs the senses, and leads us to imagine a new ending to this familiar journey. The virgin mother gives birth to our savior, but is also challenged to save herself.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWritten\/Directed by Celia Rowlson-Hall<br \/>\r\nProduced by Aaron Schnobrich, Lauren Smitelli<br \/>\r\nExecutive Produced by Riel Roch Decter, Sebastian Pardo, Neal Bledsoe, Karl Kister<br \/>\r\nCinematography by Ian Bloom<br \/>\r\nEdited by Iva Radivojevic<br \/>\r\nProduction Designed by  Jen Dunlap<br \/>\r\nCostume Designed by Allison Pearce<br \/>\r\nMusic Composed by Brian McOmber<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCAST: Celia Rowlson-Hall, Andrew Pastides, Amy Seimetz<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFestivals: Venice Film Festival, Rotterdam International Film Festival, AFI Film Festival, Maryland Film Festival, Sarasota Film Festival, Sidewalk Film Festival, Ashland Film Festival and more...<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\u201cA wonderful film \u2026 Conceived miraculously.\u201d<br \/>\r\n- Tasbeeh Herwees, Vice Magazine<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"A silent film that is anything but quiet.\"<br \/>\r\n- Katie Walsh, The Playlist<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\u201cAstonishing, and easily one of the most brazen and beautiful independent films I\u2019ve seen in years.\u201d<br \/>\r\n- Susanna Locascio, Hammer To Nail",

    "description": "In his documentaries, German filmmaker Werner Herzog has made poetic pessimism his trademark. His voice overs seem to bask in the bleakness of their own words, sometimes making it hard to gauge whether he is serious or jesting.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPeet Gelderblom's mash-up plays on this aspect by combining audio from Herzog's antarctic documentary Encounters at the End of the World with footage from a very different kind of icy movie: the animated musical Happy Feet. The result is a surrealist clash of heavy-handed narration and lighthearted visuals. It's a clash that, for one thing, reveals the appetite for Hollywoodian hyperboles in Herzog's dramatic narration.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHeading Towards Certain Death is the third instalment of Pretty Messed Up, a limited series of conceptual movie mashups by Peet Gelderblom (www.directorama.net). You may know Gelderblom from his side-by-side montage that pitted Hitchcock against De Palma in a Split Screen Bloodbath (www.vimeo.com\/193068848), or from his Director\u2019s Cut of Raising Cain (www.directorama.net\/raising-cain-directors-cut\/).<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPlease visit www.filmscalpel.com for detailed credits.<br \/>\r\nThis video was made solely for educational purposes and makes \"fair use\" of copyrighted material.
